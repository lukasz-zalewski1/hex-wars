# hex-wars (2019)

## Description
This game is inspired by another game called [Dicewars](https://www.gamedesign.jp/games/dicewars/)

<br>

The goal of this game is to conquer all enemy fields. You play as **Red** and fight other colorful enemies. 

The game is turn based. Each turn you can select your attacking field and battle against adjacent to your hexagon enemy fields. "The dice", which count is based on the number you can see on each field, are rolled. If you managed to get better a result than the enemy, you take his field. If you didn't, you lose all but 1 of your forces on your attacking field. Then all of your enemies will take their turn. At the end of every turn forces of all players grow depending on number of their adjacent fields. 

**Hex-Wars** is a fully customizable experience. You can adjust size of the map, number of players, how many sides "a die" has or how many of them can fill into a single field.
